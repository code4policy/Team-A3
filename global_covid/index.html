        <h2>Can we see the air pollution - corona correlation on a global level?</h2>

        <!-- Paragraphs -->
        <p>The incidence and death rate of COVID-19 has varied significantly between states, regions and even localities. Some factors that explain these differences have been known very early into the pandemic: The age distribution of populations, mobility, population density or medical preconditions such as diabetes or obesity.</p>

        <p>Medical professionals and scientists have been researching whether there are also contributing environmental factors that cause COVID19 to spread faster or pose a higher risk to specific populations. New research coming out of that effort in 2020 indicates that air pollution could contribute to higher numbers of COVID19 deaths. The following video by the World Health organisation explains the medical basics about why air pollution can be an underlying risk factor for COVID-19. </p>

        <p> Most prominently, a <a href='https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/c-change/subtopics/coronavirus-and-pollution/'>study</a> from the Harvard T.H.Chan School of Public Health found that "a small increase in the long-term exposure to PM 2.5 leads to a large increase in the COVID-19 death rate". PM2.5 refers to particulate matter (also called particle pollution) of a specific size: 2.5 micrometers and smaller. For context, think about a single hair from your head. This is on average 70 micrometers in diameter, making it 30 times larger than the largets fine particles. Let's have a look on a country-by-country basis first. </p>

		<p>As can be seen above, the level of air quality as measured the mean annual PM 2.5 air pollution concentration, varies a lot between country. Given the results of multiple studies (as summarised on our <a href='../literature_review.html'>literature review</a> page) one might think that we might now see a correlation between PM 2.5 and COVID-19 death rate on a country-by-country basis. However, this is not the case: </p>

		<p>How come? There are two main reasons why it is difficult to look at this issue with average country-by-country data. Firstly, air pollution is a highly localised issue. Most particulate matter comes from so called "point sources". So unlike CO2, which is an atmospheric gas with similar concentrations everywhere (apart from the North Pole), particulate matter concentrations are much higher close to their sources than elsewhere. Most particles form in the atmosphere as a result of complex chemical reactions of sulfur dioxide and nitorgen oxides, which are pollutants emitted from power plants, industrial plants but also automobiles. This means that looking at national mean values is not necessarily picking up in which region air concentration is high and the correlation with COVID-19 deaths might not be linear.</p>
		
		<p>Secondly, data on COVID-19 death rates, measured as deaths per 100k, is highly dependant on testing. In countries with less testing, or improper reporting of the reason of death, this measure is not representative. Take the example below: When we start to look at regions with high test rates and high levels of reporting the reason for death (taking countries in the EU as a proxy-group), we see a positive correlation emerging. </p>

        <p>"Our word in data" has some great charts to show the extent of testing relative to the scale of the outbreak in different countries. The chart below shows the daily number of tests on the vertical axis agains the daily number of new confirmed cases on the horizontal axis - per million people. We can see that some countries are doing ten or hundred times fewer tests than other countries but still report a similar number of new confirmed cases. Our world in data explains: "Where the number of confirmed cases is high relative to the extent of testing, this suggests that there may not be enough tests being carried out to properly monitor the outbreak".
