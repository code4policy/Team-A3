        <h2>Can we see the air pollution - corona correlation on a global level?</h2>

        <!-- Paragraphs -->
        <p>The incidence and death rate of COVID-19 has varied significantly between states, regions and even localities. Some factors that explain these differences have been known very early into the pandemic: The age distribution of populations, mobility, population density or medical preconditions such as diabetes or obesity.</p>

        <p>Medical professionals and scientists have been researching whether there are also contributing environmental factors that cause COVID19 to spread faster or pose a higher risk to specific populations.New research coming out of that effort in 2020 indicates that air pollution could contribute to higher numbers of COVID19 deaths.</p>
