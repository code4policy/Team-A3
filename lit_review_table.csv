"""Air pollution aggravating COVID-19 lethality? Exploration in Asian cities using statisticsl models""","Gupta, Bherwani et al., 2020","Environment, Development and Sustainability","Looking at data from nine Asian cities, the paper finds that ""past exposures to high level of PM2.5 over a long period [...] significantly correlate[s] with present COVID-19 mortality per unit reported cases (p < 0.05)"".

"""Air Pollution and COIVD-19: The Role of Particulate Matter in the Spread and Increase of COVD-19's Morbidity and Mortality""","Comunian, Dongo et al., 2020",International Journal Environmental Research and Public Health,Meta study on several correlation studies. Two potential causal links need further investigation: 1) long-term exposure to high PM2.5 levels increases the COVID death rate by causing underlying cardiovascular diseases and (b) short-term exposure to PM2.5 levels could cause a faster spreading of the virus ans PM particles can carry virusload,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7345938/
"""Initial evidence of higher morbidity and mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 in regions with lower air quality.""","Pansini, Fornacca",,"The authors correlated geographical expansion of infections with the annual means of PM10, PM2.5, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoyide, nitrogen dioxide and ozone. The found significant positive correlations in all examined regions in China, Italy and the US and ""concluded that higher mortality was also correlated with high PM2.5, carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide values""",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.04.20053595v2
"""Particulate matter and SARS-CoV-2: A possible model of COVD-19 transmission""","Tung, Cheng et al., 2020","Science of the Total Environment, 2021","SARS-CoV-2 has ""a high affinity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Idirectly, exposure to PM increases ACE2 expression in the lungs which facilitates SARS-CoV-2 viral adhesion. [...] PM could be both a direct and indirect transmission model for SARS-CoV-2 infection""",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7403850/
"""Links between air pollution and COVID-19 in England""","Travaglio, Yu, Popovic et al., 2020",Environmental Pollution,"Controlling for population density, age and median income, the autors show ""a positive relationship between air pollutant concentrations […] and COVID-19 mortality and infectivity"" in the UK. Futher, ""an increase of 1 m3 in the long-term averageof PM2.5 was associated with a 12% increase in COVID-19 cases.

Its gfindings suggest, that outdoor airborne aerosols might be possible routes of COVID-19 diffusion and that the warm season will not stop COVID-19 spreading.

"""Regional and global contributions of air pollution to risk of death from COVID-19""","Pozzer, Dominici et al., 2020",Cardiovascular Research,"The authors conclude that air pollution ""is an important cofactor increasing the risk of mortality from COVID-19. this provides extra motivation for combining ambitious policies to reduce air pollution with measures to control the transmission of COVID-19""",https://academic.oup.com/cardiovascres/article/116/14/2247/5940460?login=true
"""How do low wind speeds and high levels of air pollution support the spread of COVID-19?""","Coccia, 2020",Atmospheric Pollution Research,"High air pollution can interact with viral agents and increase infection numbers and death rates. Conversely, high wind speeds improve the dispersion of particulate matters mixed with viral agents. Cities with high wind speed and low air pollution have a lower number of infected individuals of COVID-19.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1309104220302932

At present, publicly available COVID-19 outcome data ""are available only as area-level counts.
