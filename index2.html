		<p>It was a big mystery in the spring: why were so many people in Bergamo, New York and other regions getting so badly sick with Covid-19, but not in other regions? One theory that was quickly at hand: it could be due to air pollution in those places. It could mean that residents - without knowing it - have pre-damaged lungs or blood vessels, a higher risk for a severe course of the disease.</p>The incidence and death rate of COVID-19 has varied significantly between states, regions and even localities. Some factors that explain these differences have been known very early into the pandemic: The age distribution of populations, mobility, population density or medical preconditions such as diabetes or obesity.</p>

		<h4> An environmental factor is shaping the pandemic:</h4>


        <p>Medical professionals and scientists have been researching whether there are also contributing environmental factors that cause COVID19 to spread faster or pose a higher risk to specific populations. New research coming out of that effort in 2020 indicates that air pollution could contribute to higher numbers of COVID19 deaths. One <a href="literature_review.html"> study </a> estimates that as much as 15% of COVID-19 deaths worldwide can be attributed to air pollution. The following video by the World Health organisation explains the medical basics about why air pollution can be an underlying risk factor for COVID-19. </p>

		<p> Researchers have been observing a curious correlation for months: COVID-19 patients seem to have more severe courses of the disease. What is behind this correlation?

		<p>It was a big mystery in the spring: why were so many people in Bergamo, New York and other regions getting so badly sick with Covid-19, but not in other regions? One theory that was quickly at hand: it could be due to air pollution in those places. It could mean that residents - without knowing it - have pre-damaged lungs or blood vessels, a higher risk for a severe course of the disease.</p>

		<p>By now, there are a <a href="literature_review.html"> host of academic studies </a> from all over the world corroborating this theory. Nonetheless, data availability and quality continue to make it hard to separate correlation from causation. This website aims to collect information about the topic, show some of the most interesting global and regional correlations, and take a deeper look at socioeconomic factors closely related to underlying health- and environmental conditions. </p>
