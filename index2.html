		 <p>The incidence and death rate of COVID-19 has varied significantly between states, regions and even localities. Some factors that explain these differences have been known very early into the pandemic: The age distribution of populations, mobility, population density or medical preconditions such as diabetes or obesity.</p>

        <p>Medical professionals and scientists have been researching whether there are also contributing environmental factors that cause COVID19 to spread faster or pose a higher risk to specific populations. New research coming out of that effort in 2020 indicates that air pollution could contribute to higher numbers of COVID19 deaths. The following video by the World Health organisation explains the medical basics about why air pollution can be an underlying risk factor for COVID-19. </p>

		<!-- Paragraphs of text -->
		<p> Researchers have been observing a curious correlation for months: COVID-19 patients seem to have more severe courses of the disease. What is behind this correlation?

		<p>It was a big mystery in the spring: why were so many people in Bergamo, New York and other regions getting so badly sick with Covid-19, but not in other regions? One theory that was quickly at hand: it could be due to air pollution in those places. It could mean that residents - without knowing it - have pre-damaged lungs or blood vessels, a higher risk for a severe course of the disease.</p>

		<p>By now, there are a <a href="literature_review.html"> host of academic studes </a> from all over the world corroborating this theory. Nonetheless, data availability and quality continue to make it hard to separate correlation from causation. This website aims to collect information about the topic, show some of the most interesting global and regional correlations, and take a deeper look at socioeconomic factors closely related to underlying health- and environmental conditions. </p>

        <h1>What about China?</h1>

        <!-- Paragraphs -->
        <p>After performing data analysis to find out if there is a potential relationship between COVID 19 and air pollution across the US, we decided to conduct similar analysis across China. We have collected China's covid 19 data from February to October 2020 and the country's air pollution data in the same period.</p>

        <p>With the data available, we made four scatterplots to find out if there are positive correlations between Covid 19 death rate in China and each of the three major pollutants (i.e. particle pollution (PM2.5 and PM10), carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide).</p>

        <p>The results are shown below:</p>

        <p>PM2.5 vs Covid 19 Death Rate</p>

        <p></p>

        <p>PM10 vs Covid 19 Death Rate</p>
        <img src='../images/pm10_vs_covid_china.png' width="600" height="800">
        <p></p>

        <p>CO vs Covid 19 Death Rate</p>
        <img src='../images/co_vs_covid_china.png' width="600" height="800">
        <p></p>

        <p>SO2 vs Covid 19 Death Rate</p>
        <img src='../images/so2_vs_covid_china.png' width="600" height="800">
        <p></p>

        <p>Contrary to our initial expectation, there is a weak positive correlation between PM2.5 and covid 19 death rate, with the correlation coefficient of 0.05. Similarly, the correlation coefficient between PM10 and covid 19 death rate is 0.16, which is still not a strong correlation. However, the correlation between CO and covid 19 death rate, and that between SO2 and covid 19 death rate are relatively strong and positive, with the correlation coefficients of 0.44 and 0.55, respectively.</p>

        <P>Since the correlation between SO2 and covid 19 death rate was the strongest, we decided to further visualize both SO2 and covid 19 death rate using the heat map of China.</P>

        <p>The visualizations are shown below:</p>

        </script>

        <p>As expected, provinces with high level of SO2 had relatively higher covid 19 death rate. However, it should be noted that the strong positive correlation between the level of SO2 and covid 19 death rate does not necessarily indicate a causal relationship between two variables. First, we do not know which of these two variables, if any, is a dependant variable. Second, even if we do, there might be one or more confounding variables that affect the correlation between SO2 level and the death rate. Therefore, in order to find out if there is a causal relationship between the two, we need to control other confounding variables, and that is beyond the scope of this page.</p>

     <h2>Any other index for comparison?</h2>
<p>For the seek more correlation wiht air quality and COVID-19 death rate, we analysis with EPA(Environmental Protection Agency) AQI(Air Quality Index).</p>

        <p>API(Air Pollution Index) : The Air Quality Index (AQI) is an index calculated for four major air pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act: ground-level ozone, particle pollution, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide.</p>
         <iframe title="[ EPA Air Quality Standard ] " aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-OQ1ZI" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/OQ1ZI/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="484"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script>

<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/52W57h5/Rplot-AQI.png" alt="Rplot-AQI" border="0"></a>

      <p>AQI index shows slightly more correlation with COVID-19 death rate.(R<sup>2</sup>=0.07483) It means ozone, carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide also impact on COVID-19 death rate.</p> 
        <h2>Why states view correlation is low?</h2>
        <p>One of the reason is air pollution monitor location.</p>
        <p>The monitor centers are not equaly spread on states. It caused bias on state level analysis.</p> 
        <p>Thus, AQI factor and COVID-19 correlation provide limited information on states view.</p>
