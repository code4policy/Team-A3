		<p>It was a big mystery in spring 2020: why were so many people in Bergamo, New York and other regions getting badly sick with COVID-19, but not in other regions? Why did the incidence rate shoot up in one place like Brussels, but stayed low in an otherwise very comparable city like Amsterdam?</p>

	<h4> An environmental factor is shaping the pandemic:</h4>


        <p>Since spring, the variance in how COVID-19 is shaping up in different places has consolidated. Some factors that explain this variance have been known very early into the pandemic: The age distribution of populations, mobility, population density or medical preconditions such as diabetes or obesity. And not least, public health measures like social distancing, quarantines or contact bans. </p>

        <p>Medical professionals and scientists soon started researching whether there are also contributing environmental factors that cause COVID19 to spread faster or pose a higher risk to specific populations. New research coming out of that effort in 2020 indicates that air pollution could be key. By now, there are a <a href="literature_review.html"> host of academic studies </a> from all over the world corroborating this theory. </p>

    <h4>15% of COVID-19 deaths worldwide could be attributed to air pollution</h4>

        <p>Both short- and long-term exposure to high levels of air pollution can cause a whole variety of adverse health outcomes. It could mean that residents - without knowing it - have pre-damaged lungs or blood vessels, a higher risk for a severe course of the disease. 
		The following video by the World Health organisation explains the medical basics about why air pollution can be an underlying risk factor for COVID-19.</p>

	<h4> An environmental factor is shaping the pandemic:</h4>

The WHO estimates https://www.who.int/news-room/air-pollution , that around 7 million people die every year from exposure to polluted air. Ambient air pollution alone caused some 4.2 million deaths in 2016, whilst household air pollution, e.g. from cooking with pollution fuels indoors caused an estimated 3.8 million deaths in the same period. </p><p>

		<img src="images/who_sources_airpollution.jpg" class="thumbnail" align="left" style="margin: 0px 10px 0px 9px"><p> Many different substances are summarised under the term air pollution. The most important ones are particulate matter (PM), ground-level ozone, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, volatile organic compounds and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. A large fraction of air pollutants is man-made. Most air pollution comes from energy use and production. This includes traffic and fuel combustion during industrial production processes.
