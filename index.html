		<!-- Paragraphs of text -->
		<p>Researchers have been observing a curious correlation for months: COVID-19 patients seem to have more severe courses of the disease. What is behind this correlation?

		<p>It was a big mystery in the spring: why were so many people in Bergamo, New York and other regions getting so badly sick with Covid-19, but not in other regions? One theory that was quickly at hand: it could be due to air pollution in those places. It could mean that residents - without knowing it - have pre-damaged lungs or blood vessels, a higher risk for a severe course of the disease.</p>

		<p>By now, there are a <a href="literature_review.html"> host of academic studes </a> from all over the world corroborating this theory. Nonetheless, data availability and quality continue to make it hard to separate correlation from causation. This website aims to collect information about the topic, show some of the most interesting global and regional correlations, and take a deeper look at socioeconomic factors closely related to underlying health- and environmental conditions. </p>
