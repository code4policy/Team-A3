<td>&quot;Air pollution aggravating COVID-19 lethality? Exploration in Asian cities using statisticsl models&quot;</td>
<td>Gupta, Bherwani et al., 2020</td>
<td>Looking at data from nine Asian cities, the paper finds that &quot;past exposures to high level of PM2.5 over a long period [...] significantly correlate[s] with present COVID-19 mortality per unit reported cases (p &lt; 0.05)&quot;. </td>

<td>Comunian, Dongo et al., 2020</td>
<td>Meta study on several correlation studies. Two potential causal links need further investigation: 1) long-term exposure to high PM2.5 levels increases the COVID death rate by causing underlying cardiovascular diseases and (b) short-term exposure to PM2.5 levels could cause a faster spreading of the virus ans PM particles can carry virusload</td>

<td>&quot;Initial evidence of higher morbidity and mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 in regions with lower air quality.&quot;</td>

<td>The authors correlated geographical expansion of infections with the annual means of PM10, PM2.5, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoyide, nitrogen dioxide and ozone. The found significant positive correlations in all examined regions in China, Italy and the US and &quot;concluded that higher mortality was also correlated with high PM2.5, carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide values&quot;</td>

<td>&quot;Particulate matter and SARS-CoV-2: A possible model of COVD-19 transmission&quot;</td>
<td>Tung, Cheng et al., 2020</td>
<td>SARS-CoV-2 has &quot;a high affinity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Idirectly, exposure to PM increases ACE2 expression in the lungs which facilitates SARS-CoV-2 viral adhesion. [...] PM could be both a direct and indirect transmission model for SARS-CoV-2 infection&quot;</td>

<td>Controlling for population density, age and median income, the autors show &quot;a positive relationship between air pollutant concentrations and COVID-19 mortality and infectivity&quot; in the UK. Futher, &quot;an increase of 1 m3 in the long-term averageof PM2.5 was associated with a 12% increase in COVID-19 cases. The correlation remains significant after adjusting for socioeconomic, demographic and health-related variables.</td>

<td>The study investigates the correlation between the degree of accelerated diffusion and lethality of COVID-19 and the surgace air pollution in Milan, Italy. Its gfindings suggest, that outdoor airborne aerosols might be possible routes of COVID-19 diffusion and that the warm season will not stop COVID-19 spreading. </td>

The relationship &quot;withstands [tests like] instrumental pollution to mitigate potential endogeneity and modelling spatial spilloversusing spatial conometric techniques&quot;</td>

<td>&quot;How do low wind speeds and high levels of air pollution support the spread of COVID-19?&quot;</td>
<td>Coccia, 2020</td>
<td>High air pollution can interact with viral agents and increase infection numbers and death rates. Conversely, high wind speeds improve the dispersion of particulate matters mixed with viral agents. Cities with high wind speed and low air pollution have a lower number of infected individuals of COVID-19.</td>

<td>Common shortcomings of existing studies on the topic include &quot;possible cross-level bias in ecological studiesunderreporting of health outcomes, using grouped data, the lack of highly spatially resolved air pollution measures, inadequate control for confounding and evaluation of effect modification, not accounting for regional variations in the timing of outbreaks&#39; temporal changes in at-ris populations, and not accounting for nonindependence of outcomes&quot;</td>

At present, publicly available COVID-19 outcome data &quot;are available only as area-level counts. Therefore, studies [..] must use an ecological regression analysis, which precludes controlling for individual-level COVID-19 risk factors&quot;</td>
